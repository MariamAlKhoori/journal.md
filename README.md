Robot Movement

Done
-Assembly of the wheels and motors
-Coding of the motors for full control using the controller. 

# October 2nd
Basic designs for the robot were drawn.
-Design idea: Cat lady. Her potential design hints towards the different sides and characters she might represent. 
-Ideas to consider: Adding a frying pan in one hand and a moving fan in the other.

Arm motors assembled. 


# October 21st & 22nd

Head is a WIP. Planning to add moving ears and an LED for the eye.

Completed: Coding for the arm motors has been successfully achieved. Some errors occurred, but after checking on the pins and fixing it to the appropriate pin, it worked well. 


# October 30th

To get done: 
* - Attach the servo motors to the ears before attaching the ears to the head
* - Code ear movement
:heavy_check_mark: * - Code and test the channels and receiver
 
To consider:
- Code eyes with the neopixels
- Code in robot commands 
- Plug music maker sheet
- Robot fabrications
