Robot Movement

Done  
- Assembly of the wheels and motors  
- Coding of the motors for full control using the controller.  

# October 2nd

Basic designs for the robot were drawn.  
- Design idea: Cat lady. Her potential design hints towards the different sides and characters she might represent.  
- Ideas to consider: Adding a frying pan in one hand and a moving fan in the other.

The robot's body is assembled from wood and cardboard. We hope to achieve a more shaped figure as we progress.

Arm motors assembled.  

# October 21st & 22nd

Head is a WIP. Planning to add moving ears and an LED for the eye.  

Completed: Coding for the arm motors has been successfully achieved. Some errors occurred, but after checking on the pins and fixing it to the appropriate pin, it worked well.  

# October 30th

To get done:  
* Attach the servo motors to the ears before attaching the ears to the head  
* Code ear movement  
* Code and test the channels and receiver ✔️
 
To consider:  
- Code eyes with the neopixels  
- Code in robot commands  
- Plug music maker sheet  
- Robot fabrications  

Mariam and Joy's Channel 50, addr = 0x7c  

# November 6th

Done this week:  
- Music Maker Shield  
- Rehearsals  
- Neopixels  

Issues faced:  
- The robot is not balanced when driving around  
- One arm fell off  
- Music Maker Shield took some time to fix  
- Neopixels  

To fix and do by next week:  
- Code the Neopixel expressions  
- Robot movement speed (robot balance)  
- Try to code in commands connected by the controller  

To consider:  
- Props & Costume Loan  
- Script revision

# November 15th 

Done
- Robot balance
- Arm attachment
- Nose shape

To Do
- script voicing
- Coding speed of the robot
- controller commands
- Ear design
- Ear attachment

To consider:  
- Hands props attachment
- Painting face
- Neopixel face codes

# November 21st-22nd

For elevenlabs, since we don’t have a subscription, we internally record every sound, so if we want to add more, we might need to use another laptop, cause there’s a trial limit cookie for how many times an unlogged user can use

For neopixels, Joy spent so much time for better results, it’s good enough if we look at it from an audience distance, besides the Monroe one. Also made a sprite of an anime girl in the code that we might comment out to use(attached for reference)

For arms, all cases are matching the flow of the play now. We just need to do a for loop for the waving arms dance move

For the battery, we might need to clarify how we allocate each with Prof, and ask for a new one

For wheels, we referenced others' code and flipped everything as the supposed front side for the code and the hobby motor. Now it’s much more balanced, and now we have a toggle handle for driving and wheels for turning

Ears motor attachment is done, we just need to code it in the proper position and add it to the cases.
